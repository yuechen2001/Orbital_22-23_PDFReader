# 📘 PDF Tailor – A Customizable PDF Reader

> **An offline Flutter-based PDF reader for students, TAs, and educators that enhances readability, accessibility, and productivity.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

PDF Tailor allows users to download, organize, style, and annotate PDF files—offline. Born from the frustrations of black-and-white study materials, this tool aims to enhance readability with features like dark mode, annotation, and intuitive organization.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎨 **Background Color Modes** – Light, Dark, and Sepia filters using transformation matrices.
- 📝 **PDF Annotation** – Add, move, resize, and persist text boxes across sessions.
- 📂 **File Management** – Organize PDFs into folders, favorite important documents, and track recent files.
- 🔍 **Zoom Controls** – Keyboard shortcuts + UI buttons for PDF zooming and fitting.
- ⚠️ **Smart File Handling** – Detects deleted files and updates UI accordingly.

## 🧠 Why It Stands Out

Unlike mainstream PDF readers:
- Focused on readability (dark mode and sepia).
- Minimalist and intuitive UI.
- Offline-first with lightweight local storage (HiveDB).
- Tailored to academic workflows (e.g., cheat sheets, lecture annotations).

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: HiveDB (NoSQL local storage)

## 👥 Target Audience

- University Students
- Teaching Assistants
- Professors

## 📄 User Stories

- "As a student, I want to style notes for readability."
- "As a TA, I want to annotate and review submissions offline."
- "As a user, I want to favorite and access key PDFs easily."

## 📈 Development Milestones

**Milestone 1 & 2**
- Background styling
- Recent & favorite files
- Zoom controls and view-fit

**Milestone 3**
- Annotations with text boxes
- Folder-based file organization
- Persistent file states (e.g., zoom level, last page)

## 🧪 Testing & QA

- Manual unit, integration, and beta testing
- Bugs fixed around UI, state persistence, and file handling
- Limitations: No authentication, no in-app file search, draw feature omitted

## 🔐 Software Engineering Principles

- **MVC Pattern** for modularity and maintainability
- **DRY Principle** via component abstraction (e.g., side nav)
- **ClickUp** for project tracking; **GitHub PRs** for team collaboration

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Orbital offered us a full-cycle development experience—from ideation and UI design to debugging and testing. Through challenges and iterations, we've built a solution that truly caters to academic needs, and we're excited to share it with fellow learners.
